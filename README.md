# OpenCV-Playground
Leveling up my computer vision skills, one project at a time. This repo is a living timeline of my journey from "Hello, World!" to "Hello, fully functional hand-controlled app!" 

Currently obsessed with hand detection and building the future, one gesture at a time. Think less mouse, more magic. ✋

## 🚀 The Vibe
This isn't just another tutorial graveyard. It's a curated collection of my projects, from beginner-friendly scripts to advanced, portfolio-worthy applications. All code is documented, explained, and (hopefully) pretty cool.

## 🔥 What's Cooking? (Project Roadmap)

### 🧑‍💻 The Main Quest (Hand Detection & Gesture Control)
- [x] **Basic Hand Detection:** Track your hand in real-time using your webcam.
- [x] **Finger Counter:** The classic - how many fingers are you holding up?
- [x] **Gesture Recognition System:** Decoding static hand signs (like "peace" ✌️, "ok" 👌, "thumbs up" 👍)
- [x] **Virtual Mouse:** Control your computer cursor with your hand. ✋➡️🖱️
- [ ] **Air Guitar App:** Strumming invisible strings to make real music. 🎸
- [ ] **Gesture Volume Control:** Wave your hand to turn the volume up/down. 🔈
- [ ] **Rock, Paper, Scissors AI:** Finally settle the score against a machine. ✊📄✂️

### 🧠 Big Brain Energy (Future Ideas)
- [ ] **Sign Language Translator:** Start with translating the alphabet.
- [ ] **AR Drawing App:** Draw in 3D space using your finger as a brush.
- [ ] **Fitness Rep Counter:** Count your push-ups or squats using pose estimation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **OpenCV** (The main powerhouse) 
- **MediaPipe** (For super accurate hand tracking) 🤙
- **NumPy** (For all the math magic)

**Follow my journey from zero to computer vision hero!** PRs and ideas are always welcome. Let's build the future, together. 

*P.S. Yes, the pun in "on hand detection" was fully intended. You're welcome.*
